# Node + Express + Express Templates ARE BUSTED!

## Task

* Find all the errors in the code and fix them so the app runs
* There are _multiple_ errors (~15 of them). The app won't run intil they're _all_ fixed.
* As you make it through one error, be on the lookout for the next one.
* __ALL__ files are in play (except `package-lock.json`).

## Getting started

* First, run `npm i` to install all the dependencies
* Then run `npm run dev` to start the app.
* Start fixing!

### Notes

* LOOK AT SPELLING ERRORS AND/OR TYPOS!
* Variable names are CASE SENSITIVE!
* **SERIOUSLY** almost _every_ file is in play!
* In these files I used the shorter `req` and `res` in place of `request` and `response`. They're the same objects, just using shorter variable names.
* Don't forget the HTML files!! Make sure things like links work!
